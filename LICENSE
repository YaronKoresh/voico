UNIVERSAL COPYLEFT SOURCE LICENSE (UCSL-1.0)

TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING USE, REPRODUCTION, DEPLOYMENT, MODIFICATION, AND
DISTRIBUTION

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, the paramount, immutable, and overriding objective of this Instrument
is to secure, in perpetuity, the unalienable liberty of the Licensee, and all
subsequent recipients, heirs, successors, and assigns, to disseminate, examine,
scrutinize, and modify all iterations of the Software without hindrance,
proprietary obfuscation, legal encumbrance, or technological restriction; and

WHEREAS, it is the express, declared, and manifest intent of the Licensor(s) to
ensure that the Software remains unencumbered for the communal benefit of all
users, whilst simultaneously safeguarding the proprietary rights, moral rights
(where applicable), and reputational integrity of the Licensor(s) against
misappropriation, misrepresentation, or unauthorized distinctiveness; and

WHEREAS, the advancement of the digital arts and the preservation of the
technological commons necessitates a robust, defensible, and comprehensive
legal framework that explicitly prevents the enclosure of the commons through
the utilization of restrictive patent claims, the withholding of essential
source code, or the imposition of digital rights management schemes that
contravene the user's autonomy; and

WHEREAS, the Licensor(s) desire to permit the unrestricted commercial and
private utilization of the Software, provided that such utilization does not
infringe upon, diminish, or abrogate the reciprocal obligations of
transparency, attribution, and shared improvement inherent in the copyleft
philosophy; and

WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge that the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change, and improve the software are rights of paramount importance that
supersede any temporary commercial advantage gained by the suppression of the
source code; and

WHEREAS, strictly to prevent the commoditization of the Software in a manner
that deprives the community of improvements, strict adherence to the provisions
of source disclosure and patent safety is mandated;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, promises, and
warranties contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Licensor(s) hereby
mandate that any Derivative Works, howsoever generated, shall be governed by
these identical terms, thereby establishing a permanent, indivisible, and
self-perpetuating commons of accessible code.

ARTICLE 1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

1.1. "Instrument" shall be strictly and narrowly construed to denote the terms,
covenants, conditions, stipulations, provisos, and obligations for use,
reproduction, and distribution as set forth within this document, functioning
as the binding, exclusive, and final legal agreement between the Licensor and
the Licensee.

1.2. "Licensor" shall be construed to denote the original copyright holder(s),
or the entity (or entities) explicitly and legally authorized by said copyright
holder(s), to grant the rights, privileges, and immunities contained within
this Instrument.

1.3. "Legal Entity" shall be construed to denote the union of the acting entity
and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" shall
be interpreted as (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction,
policy, or management of such entity, whether by contract, governing
instrument, or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
the outstanding shares or securities, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

1.4. "Licensee" shall be construed to denote any individual, organization, or
Legal Entity exercising permissions or rights granted pursuant to this
Instrument.

1.5. "Software" shall be construed to denote the copyrightable work of
authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the
authority of this Instrument, including but not limited to computer code, data
structures, distinct interfaces, associated documentation, and any audio-visual
content embedded therein.

1.6. "Source Code" shall be construed to denote the preferred form of the work
for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, configuration files, interface definition files, and
compilation scripts utilized to control compilation and installation of an
executable. To be considered valid under this Instrument, Source Code must be
transparent, human-readable, and devoid of intermediate forms of obfuscation,
pre-processing, or binary-only blobs that hinder modification.

1.7. "Corresponding Source" shall be construed to denote the entirety of the
Source Code for the work, including all interface definition files, in addition
to the scripts utilized to control compilation and installation of the
executable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this definition shall not encompass
the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
free programs which are utilized unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.

1.8. "System Libraries" shall be construed to denote any software or library
that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but
which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of
the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
which an implementation is available to the public in Source Code form. A
"Major Component", within this context, shall signify a major essential
component (including, inter alia, the kernel or window system) of the specific
operating system (if any) on which the executable work operates, or a compiler
utilized to produce the work, or an object code interpreter utilized to execute
it.

1.9. "Object Code" shall be construed to denote any non-source form of a work,
including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
byte-code, and conversions to other media types or formats.

1.10. "Derivative Works" shall be construed to denote any work, whether in
Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Software,
including revisions, annotations, elaborations, translations, portations, or
other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of
authorship. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Software is part of a larger
work or "Combined Work" that links or binds the Software with other code
(whether statically or dynamically), the entire combination constitutes a
Derivative Work.

1.11. "Contribution" shall be construed to denote any work of authorship,
including the original version of the Software and any modifications or
additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Software by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" shall mean
any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication transmitted to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
systems.

1.12. "Contributor" shall be construed to denote the Licensor and any
individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received
by the Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Software.

1.13. "Distribute" shall be construed to denote the act of rendering the
Software or Derivative Works available to any third party, whether by physical
transfer, network download, peer-to-peer file sharing, or any other method of
transmission or access.

1.14. "Installation Information" shall be construed to denote any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of the Software or Derivative Works on a User
Product.

1.15. "User Product" shall be construed to denote (1) a "consumer product",
which is any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.

1.16. Rules of Construction. Unless the context otherwise requires, words
importing the singular include the plural and vice versa. The definitions of
"Licensor", "Contributor", and "Copyright Holder" shall be interpreted to
encompass singular individuals, groups of individuals, or single or multiple
Legal Entities, as the case may be.

ARTICLE 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to strict compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Instrument, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license is hereby conferred by
each Contributor upon the Licensee to:

   (a) reproduce the Software in copies, whether in physical or electronic
       media;

   (b) prepare Derivative Works based upon the Software, including the
       translation and adaptation of the code into different programming
       languages;

   (c) publicly display and publicly perform the Software;

   (d) sublicense the Software (strictly under the terms of this Instrument);
       and

   (e) Distribute the Software and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
       form.

2.2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Instrument, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in Section 2.3) patent license is hereby
conferred by each Contributor upon the Licensee to make, have made, use, offer
to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software. This license
applies solely to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Software to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

2.3. Patent Retaliation and Defense. In the event that patent litigation is
instituted by the Licensee against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software or a Contribution
incorporated within the Software constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any and all patent licenses granted to the Licensee under
this Instrument for said Software shall be deemed automatically terminated as
of the date such litigation is filed.

ARTICLE 3. CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

The rights enumerated in Article 2 are strictly predicated upon compliance with
the following provisions:

3.1. Obligation of Corresponding Source Disclosure.

   (a) Availability Mechanism: Should the Software or any Derivative Works be
       Distributed by the Licensee in any form (including binary, object code,
       or executable form), the Corresponding Source for the Software and/or
       Derivative Works must be rendered accessible to all recipients. Said
       Corresponding Source shall be provided via a standard network mechanism
       (e.g., a publicly accessible repository or server) at no charge. The
       mechanism must be prominent, reliable, and clearly communicated to the
       recipient.

   (b) Completeness of Disclosure: The Corresponding Source must include
       everything needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
       the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
       those activities.

   (c) Duration and Integrity: The Corresponding Source must remain accessible
       for a duration of no less than three (3) years from the last date of
       distribution of the binary, or for as long as the Licensee offers
       customer support for that model, whichever period is longer.

3.2. Installation Information (Anti-Tivoization).
In the event that the Licensee Distributes the Software or Derivative Works in,
or for use with, a User Product, the Licensee is obligated to provide
Installation Information alongside the Corresponding Source. This requirement
is intended to ensure that the recipient possesses the ability to install and
execute modified versions of the Software on the User Product, thereby
preserving the user's freedom to modify the software they utilize. The Licensee
shall not restrict the installation of modified software through the use of
digital signatures, cryptographic keys, or hardware limitations unless the
requisite keys or codes to bypass such restrictions are expressly provided to
the recipient. The provision of Installation Information must be sufficient to
ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

3.3. Strict Copyleft Covenant.

   (a) Viral Scope: No further restrictions shall be imposed by the Licensee on
       the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this Instrument.
       Any Derivative Works Distributed by the Licensee must be Distributed
       under the terms of THIS Instrument and no other.

   (b) Prohibition on Sublicensing: The sublicensing of the Software or
       Derivative Works under terms differing from this Instrument is strictly
       prohibited. This Copyleft condition shall apply to the work in its
       entirety, including all linked components, libraries, and modules that
       form a single unified program, with the sole exception of System
       Libraries as defined in Section 1.8.

   (c) Aggregate Works Exception: The mere aggregation of another work not
       based on the Software with the Software (or with a work based on the
       Software) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium shall not
       cause said other work to fall under the scope of this Instrument,
       provided that the aggregation does not form a single logical program.

3.4. Preservation of Notices and Attribution.

   (a) All copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices contained
       within the Source form of the Software must be retained in the Source
       form of any Derivative Works distributed by the Licensee, excluding
       those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.

   (b) If the Software includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works Distributed by the Licensee must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
       NOTICE file.

ARTICLE 4. RESERVATION OF TRADEMARK AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

4.1. No Trademark License. Nothing in this Instrument shall be construed as
granting permission, privilege, or license to utilize the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, or product names of the Licensor or any
Contributor, except as strictly required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.

4.2. Protection of Brand Integrity. The Licensee shall not utilize the
trademarks of the Licensor in a manner that suggests endorsement, sponsorship,
or affiliation where none exists. The name of the Licensor or the names of any
Contributors shall not be utilized to endorse or promote products derived from
this Software without specific prior written permission. The Licensor reserves
the right to require the Licensee to remove any such names or marks from
Derivative Works if the Licensee's modifications are deemed, in the Licensor's
sole discretion, to be damaging to the Licensor's reputation.

ARTICLE 5. SPECIFIC DISCLAIMER FOR HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES

The Software is not designed, intended, authorized, or warranted to be suitable
for use in environments or applications requiring fail-safe performance,
including but not limited to:

   (a) the operation of nuclear facilities;
   (b) aircraft navigation, communication, or flight control systems;
   (c) air traffic control systems;
   (d) direct life support machines;
   (e) weapons systems; or
   (f) any other application in which the failure of the Software could lead
       directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
       damage ("High Risk Activities").

The Licensor and Contributors specifically disclaim any express or implied
warranty of fitness for such High Risk Activities.

ARTICLE 6. TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS

6.1. Automatic Termination for Breach. This Instrument and the rights,
licenses, and immunities granted hereunder shall automatically terminate in the
event of non-compliance by the Licensee with any term herein.

6.2. Provision for Cure of Breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the
Licensee cease all acts constituting a violation of this Instrument, then the
Licensee's license from a particular Contributor shall be reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally
terminates the license, and (b) permanently, provided that the Contributor
fails to notify the Licensee of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
sixty (60) days following the cessation of the violation.

6.3. Survival of Obligations. Upon termination, those provisions which by their
nature are intended to survive (including, but not limited to, Articles 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) shall continue in full force and effect.

ARTICLE 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS
IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS. THE LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS
HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR
STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT,
ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, SAFETY, AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS BORNE BY THE LICENSEE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE, THE LICENSEE ASSUMES THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR
CORRECTION. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY THE LICENSOR OR
AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.

ARTICLE 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO THE LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS INSTRUMENT OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, DATA CORRUPTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE LICENSOR (OR CONTRIBUTORS)
EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE LICENSEE, IF ANY, FOR ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE.

ARTICLE 9. EXPORT CONTROL COMPLIANCE

The Licensee hereby acknowledges that the Software may be subject to export
control laws and regulations of the United States of America (including the
Export Administration Regulations "EAR") or other relevant jurisdictions. The
Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all applicable international and
national laws that apply to the Software, including the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination
restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. The Licensee warrants that
they are not a person or entity prohibited from receiving exports from the
United States or their local jurisdiction, nor are they a national of any
country subject to a U.S. embargo. The Licensee further agrees not to export or
re-export the Software to any prohibited country, entity, or person, including
but not limited to those on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially
Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List.

ARTICLE 10. GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1. Governing Law and Venue. This Instrument shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor maintains its principal place of business or, in the event the
Licensor is an individual, the jurisdiction of their primary residence, without
regard to its conflict of law provisions. The parties hereby unequivocally
consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the competent
courts located within said jurisdiction for any and all legal actions,
disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Instrument.

10.2. Integration and Modification. This Instrument constitutes the entire
agreement concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and representations between the parties. No modification of this
Instrument shall be binding unless in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of the Licensor (or Licensors, if applicable).

10.3. Non-Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Instrument shall be deemed a
further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the failure of
the Licensor to assert any right or provision under this Instrument shall not
constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

10.4. Severability. If any provision of this Instrument is held to be
unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The
remaining provisions of this Instrument shall remain in full force and effect.

10.5. Assignment. The Licensee may not assign or transfer this Instrument or
any rights granted hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor.
The Licensor may assign this Instrument at any time without notice.

10.6. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in
performance under this Instrument (other than for delay in the payment of money
due and payable hereunder) to the extent said failures or delays are
proximately caused by causes beyond that party's reasonable control and
occurring without its fault or negligence.

10.7. Headings. The headings contained in this Instrument are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or
interpretation of this Instrument.

10.8. Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Instrument is intended to
create any third-party beneficiaries, and no person or entity other than the
Licensor and the Licensee shall have any rights or remedies under this
Instrument.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
